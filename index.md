# The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)

This repository contains the ARC task data, as well as a browser-based interface for humans to try their hand at solving the tasks manually.

*"ARC can be seen as a general artificial intelligence benchmark, as a program synthesis benchmark, or as a psychometric intelligence test. It is targeted at both humans and artificially intelligent systems that aim at emulating a human-like form of general fluid intelligence."*

A complete description of the dataset, its goals, and its underlying logic, can be found in: [The Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547).

As a reminder, a test-taker is said to solve a task when, upon seeing the task for the first time, they are able to produce the correct output grid for *all* test inputs in the task (this includes picking the dimensions of the output grid). For each test input, the test-taker is allowed 3 trials (this holds for all test-takers, either humans or AI).
